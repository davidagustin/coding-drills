# README & Wiki Before Commit

Before committing changes:

1. **Look at the codebase** – Review what changed (new features, APIs, structure, scripts, or config) so docs stay in sync.
2. **Update README** – Add or edit README.md so it reflects current setup, usage, and behavior (e.g. new commands, env vars, features). Keep it accurate for someone cloning the repo.
3. **Update the GitHub Wiki** – Push corresponding updates to the repo's GitHub wiki (`https://github.com/davidagustin/coding-drills/wiki`). Use `gh api` or clone the wiki repo to create/update pages. The wiki should mirror major README sections with additional detail.

Do this **before** staging and committing. If the change is trivial and doesn't affect setup or usage, a README/wiki update may be unnecessary.
