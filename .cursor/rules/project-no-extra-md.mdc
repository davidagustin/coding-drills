# No Extra Markdown Files – Consolidate to README

- **Do not** create additional `.md` files (e.g. CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/*.md, task plans, assignment lists) unless they have **functional value** for the app.
- **Consolidate** all informational documentation into **README.md**.
- **Delete stale planning files** – Task breakdowns, generation plans, assignment lists, and other one-time planning documents must be deleted once completed.
- **Audit on every commit** – Before committing, run `git ls-files '*.md'` and verify the only tracked markdown files are `README.md` and `.claude/rules/*.md` (and `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`). If any other `.md` files exist, either delete them (if stale/informational) or consolidate their useful content into README.md.
- **Exception:** Create a separate markdown file only when the app or tooling **uses it at runtime** (e.g. a template, config schema doc consumed by code). Purely informational content belongs in README.md.
